The web-app has a text area.
Text of any length may be entered in the text area. The web app
should count and display the number of times each character
appeared in the text.
The character and their respective counts should be displayed in
the order that the characters appeared in the original text.
Web app should also highlight the 5 most frequent characters in
the text.
Use Tailwind CSS for some styling.
